Robot Navigation System User Guide

Introduction:
This guide is designed to help users effectively operate and understand the robot navigation system developed for the Webots simulation platform. This project demonstrates the use of advanced pathfinding algorithms to navigate a robot in a complex simulated environment.

Features:

Reduced Buffer Width: Optimized to allow the robot to navigate through narrow spaces efficiently, enhancing its ability to maneuver in densely populated or obstacle-rich environments.
Curved Path Planning: Utilizes Bézier curves to generate smoother and more natural navigation paths, improving the robot's movement and operational efficiency.

Customization:

Target Position:
Modify the target_position variable in the main() function of the simulation script to change the robot’s destination.
Obstacle Clearance:
Adjust the buffer_width parameter to increase or decrease the distance the robot maintains from obstacles, suitable for different operational environments.
